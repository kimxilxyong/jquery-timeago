This is a fork of [rmm5t/jquery-timeago](https://github.com/rmm5t/jquery-timeago) with the porpose of improving the handling of intervals. The reason why i have forked it is that i have a huge problem with clearInterval. If you call $("element").timeago() more than once it is not possible to remove the event unless you keep track of all the interval event Id's yourself! Which should not be neccessary, because thats what a plugin should be for.
This multiple calling of $("element").timeago() is fixed - an existing event is removed before creating a new one.

    // Create a new timeago event on element:
    $("element").timeago("init"); 
    // or default  
    $("element").timeago(); 
    // Delete a timeago event on element
    $("element").timeago("dispose"); 

To avoid [JavaTimer congestion](http://fitzgeraldnick.com/weblog/40/) i have included the wonderfull chronos lib from [fitzgen/chronos](https://github.com/fitzgen/chronos)
Check it out - lots of brain food.

So this is now a combination of timeago and chronos, with the ability to remove events securely and fine tune your check intervalls. Chronos makes sure there is no lag on the UI when running checks. 

Examples for overriding settings (in this case remove the "about" from the displayed text:

    // Timeago settings
    $.timeago.settings.strings.minute = "1 minute";
    $.timeago.settings.strings.hour = "a hour";
    $.timeago.settings.strings.hours = "%d hours";
    $.timeago.settings.strings.month = "a month";
    $.timeago.settings.strings.year = "a year";
    $.timeago.settings.allowFuture = true;

    // set the refresh to 30 seconds instead of 60
    // problem was that the timeago jumped from "less than a minute"
    // to "2 minutes" because of the 60 refresh
    $.timeago.settings.refreshMillis = 30000;

    // set the chronos check interval to 5 seconds instead of 50 milliseconds
    // to keep the cpu load as low as possible - it runs with 50 millis with
    // no hickups, but its just not neccessary for timeago
    chronos.minimumInterval(5000);
    
    // No existing code should be broken, you can still use:'
    // Add a timeago event to elem
    $(elem).timeago('init');
    // Remove the timer from element is now working regardless of how many inits have been sent
    $(elem).timeago('dispose');
    
This code is a working beta now, it will not burn down your house if you try it.


The following is the orginal from the wonderfull timeago plugin by  Ryan McGeary (@rmm5t) 


# timeago: a jQuery plugin

Timeago is a jQuery plugin that makes it easy to support automatically updating
fuzzy timestamps (e.g. "4 minutes ago" or "about 1 day ago") from ISO 8601
formatted dates and times embedded in your HTML (Ã  la microformats).

## Usage

First, load jQuery and the plugin:

```html
<script src="jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="jquery.timeago.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

Now, let's attach it to your timestamps on DOM ready - put this in the head
section:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
   jQuery(document).ready(function() {
     $("abbr.timeago").timeago();
   });
</script>
```

This will turn all abbr elements with a class of timeago and an ISO 8601
timestamp in the title (conforming to the
[datetime design pattern microformat](http://microformats.org/wiki/datetime-design-pattern)):

```html
<abbr class="timeago" title="2011-12-17T09:24:17Z">December 17, 2011</abbr>
```

into something like this:

```html
<abbr class="timeago" title="December 17, 2011">about 1 day ago</abbr>
```

HTML5 `<time>` elements are also supported:

```html
<time class="timeago" datetime="2011-12-17T09:24:17Z">December 17, 2011</time>
```

As time passes, the timestamps will automatically update.
